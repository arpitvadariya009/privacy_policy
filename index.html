    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 13/12/2025</p>

    <p>
        This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>Arvi Infotech</strong> (“we”, “our”, “us”)
        collects, uses, and protects user information across all our mobile games and applications

        Privacy Policy.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
        We do not collect any personally identifiable information such as name, phone number, or
        email address directly from users.
    </p>

    <p>
        Our Apps may collect limited non-personal information automatically, including:

        <li>Advertising ID (for ads and analytics)</li>
        <li>Purchase transaction details (for in-app purchases)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        Our Apps may use third-party services that collect information in accordance with their own
        privacy policies, including but not limited to:
    </p>
    <ul>

        <li>Google Play Services</li>
        <li>Google Analytics for Firebase</li>
        <li>In-App Purchase services</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Advertisements</h2>
    <p>
        Our games may display third-party advertisements such as banner ads, interstitial ads,
        and rewarded ads. Advertising partners may use cookies or similar technologies to show
        personalized or non-personalized ads.
    </p>

    <h2>4. In-App Purchases (IAP)</h2>

        We take reasonable measures to protect user information. We do not sell, trade, or rent
        user data to third parties.
